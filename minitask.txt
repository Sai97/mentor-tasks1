1.Web development is a broad term for the work involved in developing a web site for the Internet (World Wide Web)
 or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing the simplest static single page of 
 plain text to the most complex web-based internet applications, electronic businesses, and social network services.

2.A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software application for retrieving, presenting and traversing information 
 resources on the World Wide Web.
 
3.actually calling up a list of requests to get content from various resource directories or servers on which the content 
 for that page is stored. It is rather like a recipe for a cake - you have a shopping list of ingredients (requests for content)
 that when combined in the correct order bakes a cake (the web page).The page maybe made up from content from different sources.
 
4.A server is a running instance of an application (software) capable of accepting requests from the client and giving responses accordingly.

5.The basic function of a server is to listen in on a port for incoming network requests, and a good demonstration of this is the interaction
 between a Web server and browser. Although to a user the process is instantaneous, or nearly so, when he clicks a link while surfing the Web,
 several things are taking place behind the scenes: the request for the Web page is transmitted to the corresponding Web server, the server 
 fetches and assembles the Web page and retransmits it using a protocol like HTTP, and, finally, the user's browser receives the data, 
 converts it, and displays the page to him.

6.The World Wide Web (www, W3) is an information system of interlinked hypertext documents that are accessed via the Internet and built on
 top of the Domain Name System.[1] It has also commonly become known simply as the Web. Individual document pages on the World Wide Web are 
 called web pages and are accessed with a software application running on the user's computer, commonly called a web browser.
 
7.HyperText Markup Language, commonly referred to as HTML, is the standard markup language used to create web pages.[1] It is written in the
 form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets (like <html>). HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like <h1> and </h1>, 
 although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example <img>. 
 
8.Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language.
 While most often used to change the style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any kind 
 of XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL.
 
10.a dynamic programming language.[5] It is most commonly used as part of web browsers, whose implementations allow client-side scripts 
to interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document content that is displayed.[5] It 
is also used in server-side network programming with runtime environments such as Node.js, game development and the creation of 
desktop and mobile applications.

11.The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to 
link several billion devices worldwide. It is a network of networks[1] that consists of millions of private, public, academic,
 business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical 
 networking technologies. 
 
12.A uniform resource locator (URL) is a reference to a resource that specifies the location of the resource on a computer network
 and a mechanism for retrieving it. A URL is a specific type of uniform resource identifier (URI)
 
13.a uniform resource identifier (URI) is a string of characters used to identify a name of a resource. Such identification enables
 interaction with representations of the resource over a network, typically the World Wide Web, using specific protocols.
 
14.Wi-Fi (or WiFi) is a local area wireless computer networking technology that allows electronic devices to network

15.HTTP or Hypertext Transfer Protocol is the main protocol of the World Wide Web. When you request a web page by typing its 
address into your web browser, that request is sent using HTTP. The browser is an HTTP client, and the web page server is 
(unsurprisingly) an HTTP server.
